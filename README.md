# AI SDLC Scaffold

A repository template for **AI-first software development** with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## What Is This?

This scaffold provides a structured approach to building software where AI agents do the development work and a human supervises at a high level. It organizes work into four phases — **Objectives, Design, Code, Deploy** — each with an AI instruction file (`CLAUDE.<phase>.md`) that tells agents what to check, when to check it, and what to do.

The scaffold is built on four core principles:

1. **AI-first development model** — designed for AI agents doing the work while a human supervises, defines objectives, and steers direction.
2. **Everything-in-repo** — objectives, requirements, architecture, decisions, and task tracking all live alongside the source code, versioned and always accessible to agents without external tools.
3. **Context-window efficiency** — hierarchical instructions, two-file decision records, and phase-level indexes minimize how many tokens an agent must load.
4. **Decision capture, not suppression** — agents decide autonomously within established patterns; all decisions are recorded in the repository for human review and consistency.

For a deeper discussion of the rationale, design choices, and traceability model, see [`RATIONALE.md`](RATIONALE.md).

## Quick Start

### Option A — Use `degit` (recommended)

```bash
npx degit pangon/ai-sdlc-scaffold my-project
cd my-project
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial scaffold"
```

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) copies the repository contents without carrying over git history, giving you a clean starting point. It requires Node.js but does not install any dependency in your project.

### Option B — Manual copy

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy all files and directories (including hidden ones like `.claude/`) into your new project folder.
3. Remove the `.git/` directory to start with a fresh history.
4. Initialize a new repository: `git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial scaffold"`.

### Then

1. **Run `/init`** in Claude Code: the initialization skill walks you through all customization points — project description, stakeholders, components, environments, and example decision review.
2. **Work through the phases** (Objectives → Design → Code → Deploy) using the built-in [skills](#skills) — type `/` followed by a skill name to automate each step, from requirements gathering to deployment. Alternatively, you can use custom prompts: the `CLAUDE.<phase>.md` hierarchy provides all the context the agent needs to operate correctly in each phase.

## Key Concepts

- **Phase-based development**: each phase has a directory and a `CLAUDE.<phase>.md` file that extends the root `CLAUDE.md`. Phase gates define minimum preconditions before advancing.
- **Traceability**: every artifact references others by descriptive ID (`GOAL-reduce-latency`, `REQ-F-search-by-name`, `DEC-use-postgres`), creating a chain from business need to running code. Index tables link directly to artifact files for easy navigation.
- **Two-file decisions**: active record (`DEC-kebab-name.md`) for enforcement, history file (`DEC-kebab-name.history.md`) for audit trail. Indexed per phase with trigger conditions.
- **Context-window efficiency**: hierarchical instructions, phase-level indexes, and the active/history split minimize how many tokens an agent needs to load.

## Customization

The scaffold is designed to be customized progressively as each phase produces its outputs — not all at once during initialization.

- **At project start** (`/init`): fill in the project overview in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **During the Objectives phase** (`/elicit`): define stakeholders, goals, requirements, and constraints.
- **During the Design phase** (`/design`, `/decide`): define architecture, data model, API design, and record stack decisions.
- **At the start of the Code phase** (`/plan-tasks`): customize `3-code/CLAUDE.code.md` with component guidelines and build commands (the stack is known by now).

## Skills

Claude skills automate each phase of the lifecycle. Type `/skill-name` in Claude Code to invoke them. Each skill reads the root `CLAUDE.md` and the relevant phase instructions before acting.

### Setup

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/init` | Guided project initialization — walks through all customization points: project description, and tech-stack adjustments. |

### Objectives Phase

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/elicit` | Interactive requirements elicitation — guides you through stakeholders, goals, assumptions, constraints, user stories, and requirements in the prescribed order. Creates artifacts from templates, updates indexes. |
| `/review-objectives` | Read-only dashboard of all objectives artifacts. Shows counts by status, traceability gaps, conflicts, and Objectives→Design gate readiness. |

### Design Phase

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/design` | Draft or update architecture, data model, or API design documents based on approved requirements. Define components, tech-stack, and environments. References requirements by ID for traceability. |
| `/decide` | Record, review, deprecate, or supersede design decisions. Creates both `DEC-kebab-name.md` and `DEC-kebab-name.history.md`, updates all phase indexes. |

### Code Phase

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/plan-tasks` | Generate development tasks from approved requirements and design. Populates `tasks.md` with IDs, priorities, requirement links, and an execution plan. |
| `/implement` | Execute the next task (or a specified `TASK-kebab-name`) following the full procedure: read requirements, check decisions, implement with tests, handle design gaps, update status. |
| `/fix` | Structured bug-fix workflow: write failing test, fix, check for same pattern elsewhere, ask before fixing other occurrences. |

### Deploy Phase

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/deploy` | Generate or update IaC, deployment scripts, and runbooks. Flags cost drivers, enforces idempotency, links to requirements. |

### Cross-Phase

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/status` | Project-wide dashboard: artifact counts per phase, task progress, decision summary, and phase-gate readiness for every transition. |
| `/phase-gate` | Check preconditions for a specific phase transition (e.g., `/phase-gate design`). Reports MET/NOT MET per precondition with evidence. Gates are advisory — warns but proceeds on user confirmation. |
| `/trace` | Given any artifact ID, walks the traceability chain upstream (why does this exist?) and downstream (what depends on this?). Reports gaps and broken links. |

### Typical Workflow

```
/init                ← set up project: description
/elicit              ← define stakeholders, goals, requirements (Draft)
/review-objectives   ← check completeness
                     ← human approves artifacts (Draft → Approved)
/phase-gate design   ← verify gate
/design              ← draft architecture, components, data model, API, environments
/decide              ← capture decisions as they emerge
/phase-gate code     ← verify gate
/plan-tasks          ← generate task backlog
/implement           ← execute tasks one by one
/fix                 ← handle bugs
/phase-gate deploy   ← verify gate
/deploy              ← generate deployment artifacts
/status              ← anytime: full project overview
/trace REQ-F-search-by-name  ← anytime: follow dependency chains
```
