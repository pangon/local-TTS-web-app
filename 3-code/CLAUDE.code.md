Phase-specific instructions for the **Code** phase. Extends [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Purpose

This phase contains the **implementation**. Focus on clean, tested, maintainable code.

---

## Components

### Frontend

- **Directory**: [`frontend/`](frontend/)
- **Technology**: Vue 3 (Composition API), Vite
- **Responsibility**: User interface, client-side routing, audio playback, and SSE event consumption

### Backend

- **Directory**: [`backend/`](backend/)
- **Technology**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLite
- **Responsibility**: HTTP request handling, REST API, SSE endpoint, application services (Library, Job, Model, Monitor), SQLite storage, and static file serving

### TTS Engine

- **Directory**: [`tts-engine/`](tts-engine/)
- **Technology**: Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers/Hub
- **Responsibility**: All TTS inference and GPU interaction — standalone Python module independent of the web framework

---

## Component Isolation

All source code, configuration, and assets for a component **must reside within that component's directory**. Specifically:

- **No code outside component directories** — never place source files, configuration files, or build artifacts in `3-code/` itself or anywhere else outside the owning component's directory.
- **Do not rename or move component directories** — the directory names listed above are fixed; renaming or relocating them breaks cross-phase references and tooling assumptions.

---

## Build Commands

Scripts and commands for each component are documented in that component's own codebase (package.json, Makefile, README, or equivalent). Check there first.

When invoking any command, apply active decisions from the component's `CLAUDE.component.md` whose trigger conditions match.

---

## Task Tracking

All development tasks are tracked in [`tasks.md`](tasks.md).

To create the initial implementation plan (phased tasks from design artifacts), run `/SDLC-implementation-plan`. This should be done after `/SDLC-decompose` and before starting any coding work.

---

## Linking to Other Phases

- Implementation follows designs in `2-design/`
- Tests verify requirements from `1-objectives/`
- Infrastructure code goes in `4-deploy/`; when a coding task modifies IaC, the deploy phase instructions ([`CLAUDE.deploy.md`](../4-deploy/CLAUDE.deploy.md)) apply as well
