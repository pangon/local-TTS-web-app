## Language Policy

**All AI outputs must be in English**, regardless of the language used in user prompts. This applies to code, comments, documentation, configuration files, commit messages, and response text.

## Project Overview

<!-- Replace this section with a description of your project. -->

This repository uses a structured, AI-first development lifecycle. All project knowledge — objectives, design, decisions, tasks — lives alongside the source code. See [README.md](README.md) for the full directory layout.

### Current State

The project is just the base scaffold, and has not yet been inizialized. The repository contains the AI SDLC framework (phase directories, templates, automation skills) ready to be populated starting from the Objectives phase, after the inizialization has been done.

---

## Phase-Specific Instructions

Each phase directory contains a `CLAUDE.<phase>.md` file. When working in a phase:

1. Read the phase-specific instructions — they extend (not override) this file
2. Consult the decisions index in that phase file before starting work
3. Work within the appropriate phase structure

| Phase | Directory | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Objectives** | `1-objectives/` | Define what to build and why |
| **Design** | `2-design/` | Define how to build it |
| **Code** | `3-code/` | Build it |
| **Deploy** | `4-deploy/` | Ship and operate it |

### Phase Gates

Before creating artifacts in the next phase, check these minimum preconditions. Gates are advisory — warn the user if not met, but proceed if they confirm.

| Transition | Preconditions |
|------------|---------------|
| Objectives → Design | At least one goal Approved; at least one requirement Approved; stakeholders defined |
| Design → Code | `architecture.md` has content; at least one requirement has a corresponding task in `tasks.md` |
| Code → Deploy | At least one task Done |

---

## Artifacts

All project knowledge — goals, requirements, assumptions, constraints, design decisions, tasks — is captured as structured markdown files alongside the source code. This gives AI agents the full context that human developers would normally carry in their heads or scattered across external tools, and creates a traceability chain from business goals to deployed code.

### Types and locations

| Prefix | Artifact | Location |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `GOAL` | Goals | `1-objectives/goals/` |
| `US` | User Stories | `1-objectives/user-stories/` |
| `REQ-CLASS` | Requirements | `1-objectives/requirements/` |
| `ASM` | Assumptions | `1-objectives/assumptions/` |
| `CON` | Constraints | `1-objectives/constraints/` |
| `STK` | Stakeholders | `1-objectives/stakeholders.md` (rows) |
| `DEC` | Decisions | `2-design/decisions/` |
| `TASK` | Tasks | `3-code/tasks.md` (rows) |

### Naming

All artifact IDs use the pattern `PREFIX-kebab-name` — a type prefix followed by a descriptive kebab-case name. The descriptive name **is** the unique identifier (e.g., `DEC-use-postgres`, `REQ-F-search-by-name`). There are no numeric sequences, to avoid ID collisions when working on parallel branches.

### Phase indexes

Every `CLAUDE.<phase>.md` file (and `tasks.md`) contains index tables listing the artifacts in that phase. Each index must include a **File column** with a relative link to the artifact file, so that AI agents can discover the file name and human reviewers can navigate easily.

---

## Graduated Safeguards

AI agents operate autonomously within development tasks. For project-level decisions, the scaffold defines three tiers:

| Tier | When | Agent behavior |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Always ask** | Conflict resolution, design gaps, decision deprecation/supersession, phase gate advancement | Stop, present options, wait for human approval |
| **Ask first time, then follow precedent** | Naming conventions, error handling patterns, test structure | Ask once, record the decision, apply consistently afterward |
| **Decide and record** | Routine implementation choices within established patterns | Decide autonomously, record in the appropriate artifact |

When spotting a related issue, potential improvement, or ambiguous situation during a task, **surface it to the user** instead of silently deciding to act or not act.

---

## Decisions

Decisions live in `2-design/decisions/`. Each decision has two files:

- **`DEC-kebab-name.md`** — the active record (context, decision, enforcement). Read during normal task execution.
- **`DEC-kebab-name.history.md`** — the trail (alternatives, reasoning, changelog). Read only when evaluating or changing a decision.

Each `CLAUDE.<phase>.md` contains a decisions index with trigger conditions. A decision may appear in multiple phase indexes.

### How to use decisions during tasks

1. Consult the decisions index in the current phase's `CLAUDE.<phase>.md`.
2. Follow the File column link to read the relevant `DEC-*.md` file.
3. Apply its enforcement rules.

Do **not** modify `*.history.md` except to append to the changelog.

### Recording, deprecating, or superseding decisions

When a significant decision, pattern, or constraint emerges, record it as a new decision. For the recording procedure, as well as deprecation and supersession, see [`2-design/decisions/PROCEDURES.md`](2-design/decisions/PROCEDURES.md).

## After Making Changes

Evaluate whether to:

1. **Update this file** if project-wide patterns or architecture change significantly.
2. **Update phase-specific files** (`CLAUDE.<phase>.md`) if phase-specific patterns or conventions are established.
3. **Create new instruction files** if a workflow becomes complex enough to need dedicated guidance.

Proactively suggest these updates when relevant.
